## Hello!
My name is Doruk Gunveren, and I am currently a student at Cemberlitas Anatolian High School in Istanbul, Turkey. I am actively pursuing personal and academic growth in the field of software development, with a particular focus on image processing technologies. This area—encompassing object detection, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence integration—enables me to address real-world challenges through innovative and technical solutions.

I currently serve as a software developer for four FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) teams and one VEX Robotics team. These roles have allowed me to strengthen not only my technical proficiency but also my problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and leadership skills in collaborative and dynamic environments.

Beyond my involvement in technology, I have a deep appreciation for the arts. I have been studying the violin for several years, which has cultivated my discipline, concentration, and creative thinking.

I hold leadership roles in various school clubs, where I collaborate with peers to develop innovative projects. Additionally, I actively participate in volunteer initiatives, aiming to make a positive impact on my community.

I have a strong interest in language learning and cultural diversity. My native language is Turkish. I am proficient in English and possess intermediate proficiency in German.
